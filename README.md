### Tutorial on integrating Git and Github into your data analysis workflow

We will rely heavily on materials developed by others:
- Leon Eyrich Jessen's diagram on program organization: [https://twitter.com/jessenleon/status/964236119658418176]
- Git for humans slide deck: [https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans]
- Happy Git and GitHub for the useR: [http://happygitwithr.com/]
- Jenny Bryanâ€™s workshop from RStudio::conf 2017: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/happy-git-and-gihub-for-the-user-tutorial/]

The file [Good Enough Git and GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/corinne-riddell/github-mathematical-modeling/blob/master/Good-enough-github-workflow.md) describes how to use Git + GitHub in your day-to-day analysis life. 

This post about workflow is also very useful: https://andrewbtran.github.io/NICAR/2018/workflow/docs/01-workflow_intro.html?utm_content=buffer858fd&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer
